# digital-clock

This is the repo for the digital clock i made by connecting an arduino nano with several 7-segment LED displays
as well as a speaker that would play "Canon in D" as an alarm.


Clock.ino is the 'main' file.
It countains the setup and loop functions that make the clock run.
Canonind.ino handles the speaker system exclusively.
This code is not completely mine, I used some pre-exisitng libraries and other open source content while making this.
